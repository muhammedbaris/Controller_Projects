# 📊 Close the Books Faster – Dashboard Project

This project simulates a monthly financial close tracker, designed for companies operating in multiple countries — in this case, Germany and the Netherlands.

## 🔍 Project Purpose

Built entirely in Excel, this dashboard helps simulate the type of process oversight a Financial Controller would perform during close week — providing visibility into:

- Task status and progress
- Overdue and blocked items
- Country-level and department-level metrics
- Readiness for a Day 4 close

## 📈 Business Value

- Helps teams monitor close execution in real-time
- Supports faster and more accurate month-end closing
- Highlights bottlenecks and inefficiencies
- Prioritizes critical reconciliations and journal entries

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- Excel (advanced formulas, pivot tables, dashboards)
- Financial close process understanding
- KPI reporting
- Risk-based task tracking

## 📎 Files Included

- `Financial_Close_Tasks_With_Formulas.xlsx` – Main Excel dashboard
- `Summary_Insights.pdf` – 1-page summary of insights, business value, and recommendations
